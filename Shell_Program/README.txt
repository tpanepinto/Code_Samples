Running make creates two object files. 
The first .o file myshell contains a working shell that mimics and pipes commands to the linux shell.
The Second, myhistory adds on to myshell by including a history of commands by entering the command "history". 

Both programs can be exited by issuing the "quit" command in the shell.
