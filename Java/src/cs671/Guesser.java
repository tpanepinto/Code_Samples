/** A "guesser" interface.  A guesser is an object that produces a
 * series YES/NO questions and, based on replies to these questions,
 * eventually produces an answer to a secret finding problem.  The interface is
 * generic: type <code>T</code> represents the type of secrets
 * produced.  A guesser object is used by repeatedly calling
 * <code>makeQuestion</code> to produce a question and
 * <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code> to respond to the question,
 * until <code>hasSolved</code> returns <code>true</code>.  Before
 * this interaction starts, the guesser must be initialized using
 * method <code>initialize</code>.  All other methods throw
 * <code>IllegalStateException</code> if the guesser is not
 * initialized.
