I had lighting working without normals. I then tried adding in the normal for objects however this caused the lighting not to be shown. I then tried to go back to a state where there was no normals but this did not remedy the problem. I have set all of the lighting parameters in the redrawGLSL method. I have also changed the vertex and fragment shaders with the help of Angelâ€™s demo to include lighting parameters. I can see that the lighting parameters do have affect though because when I change the values of the ambient/difuse light, the color of the object will change.
